<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN"><strong>Our personal information retention criteria</strong>: The CCPA requires that we disclose the criteria we use to determine how long we will retain each category of personal information in the chart above.

These factors include what personal information is reasonably necessary to (i) provide our products and services or administer our relationship with a consumer; (ii) protect our business, employees, organization and others; (iii) fulfill our legal and regulatory obligations; and (iv) investigate and address issues which may include safety concerns, potential security incidents or policy violations.</span></p><h5><span lang="EN">Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose</span></h5><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In the preceding twelve (12) months, Clark has disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose.
